2016.10.27 able to read single file of ETL1C and ETL8G
2016.10.28 able to read multi files of ETL1C ETL6 ETL7 ETL8G
  next goal:load ETL4、ETL5
2016.10.29 try to write 2nd version to reading ETL1 but there are some problems in reshape and dimension.
2016.10.31 the dimension problems of 2nd version might be solved.
divided original file into 3 parts.
